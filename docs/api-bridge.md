# mua.api + Lua bridge — design

**Status: complete.** All five steps have landed. Delivered: the `mua.o` options bridge (the global
API seam `mua_set_option`/`mua_get_option` in [global.c](../src/mua/api/global.c) annotated
`FUNC_API_SINCE(1)`, the `mua.api.mua_*` registration in [bridge.c](../src/mua/lua/bridge.c), the C
options store in [options.c](../src/mua/options.c), and the `mua.o` sugar in
[runtime/lua/mua/init.lua](../runtime/lua/mua/init.lua)); **Step 1** — Lua↔Object value marshaling
and `mua.g`; **Step 2** — `mua_register_tool`, user-defined tools from Lua, with the
`cjson_to_object`/`object_to_cjson` converter the later steps reuse; **Step 3** — the autocmd event
set, dispatched from main.c at the agent's existing callback seams; **Step 4** — the session scope
`mua_sess_*`, the first integer-handle (`Session`) read API; and **Step 5** — the `--embed`
msgpack-RPC server over a shared dispatch table that also drives the Lua bridge. This file is the
design record for the milestone — the sequence that took `mua.api` from "options only" to the full
neovim-style surface: user tools, autocmd hooks, session scope, and an `--embed` RPC frontend.

These steps wrap the agent; they never bypass it. The load-bearing contracts they bind are
the "Agent invariants" under Architecture in [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) (the full design
record for those is [agent-milestone.md](agent-milestone.md)). The two that matter most here:
**#4** — tool failures are `ToolResult{is_error}`, never `Error *`; the registry shape
(name/description/schema/callback) is the seed of `mua_register_tool` — and **#5** — the
agent gate is a single function-pointer chokepoint the Lua `ToolPre` hook wraps.

## Foundation (baseline at the milestone's start)

What the sequence built on, captured before Step 1 — which has since added the Object↔Lua
marshaling and the shared `api_copy_object`/`api_free_object` that the "scalars only" bullet
below predates:

- **API types** ([defs.h](../src/mua/api/private/defs.h)): the `Object` tagged union already
  carries `kObjectTypeArray`/`kObjectTypeDict` alongside the scalars, `Array`/`Dict` structs
  are defined, and `Session` is a `handle_T` (`int32_t`) with `0` documented as "current".
  `FUNC_API_SINCE(x)` is a no-op macro today — a forward slot for a dispatch generator.
- **Lua marshaling is scalars only**: `lua_to_object` in [bridge.c](../src/mua/lua/bridge.c)
  handles string/number/boolean/nil. There is **no** `object_to_lua`, and no table↔Array/Dict
  path. This is the gating gap for everything that passes a structured value.
- **Tools**: a static `tool_defs[]` of `ToolDef{name, description, params_schema, mutating,
  execute}` in [tools.c](../src/mua/tools.c); `tools_lookup` and `tools_build_openai_array`
  iterate it. The execute contract (`ToolExecuteFn(cJSON *args, ToolDoneCb done, void *ud)`,
  [tools.h](../src/mua/tools.h)) is uniform: sync tools fire `done` inline and return `NULL`;
  async tools return a cancellable handle. Failures are `ToolResult{content, is_error}`.
- **Gate + callbacks** ([agent.h](../src/mua/agent.h)): `AgentCallbacks` holds `on_text`,
  `on_tool_start`, `on_tool_result`, `on_finish`, and the `AgentGateFn gate` chokepoint
  (`(ud, tool, args, char **refusal) -> GateDecision`). The agent fires these at fixed points
  in [agent.c](../src/mua/agent.c) — they are the exact seams the autocmd events attach to.
- **Session**: `SessionState` owns the conversation as a borrowable cJSON array;
  `session_messages`/`session_message_get`/`session_id` in [session.c](../src/mua/session.c)
  read it. The run uses one implicit current session (`setup_session`…`session_free` in
  [main.c](../src/mua/main.c)); there is no handle→pointer table yet.
- **RPC seam**: the `luaL_Reg api_functions[]` table in [bridge.c](../src/mua/lua/bridge.c)
  holds `lua_CFunction` pointers — meaningless to a non-Lua frontend. A shared metadata layer
  has to come first; the comment in [global.c](../src/mua/api/global.c) already names "an
  `--embed` RPC dispatcher" as the API layer's second consumer.

### Three marshaling axes (a recurring subtlety)

The bridge converts between *three* representations, and conflating them is the easy mistake:

1. **Object ↔ Lua** — the API type system to/from Lua values (`mua.o`, `mua.g`, scalar args).
2. **cJSON ↔ Lua** — wire JSON to/from Lua: tool `arguments`, tool results, a tool's schema,
   and session messages are all wire-shaped cJSON, *not* `Object`.
3. **Object ↔ msgpack** — only for `--embed` (Step 5).

Each is a bounded-depth tree walk over model- or user-controlled structure, so each needs an
explicit depth cap (code-safety: no unbounded recursion on input-driven depth) and must treat
`String` as not NUL-terminated (length-prefixed `lua_tolstring`/`lua_pushlstring`).

## Sequence to done

Dependency-ordered. Step 1 is the cross-cutting unblocker; 2–4 each consume it; 5 is the
capstone and is mostly greenfield.

### Step 1 — Value marshaling + `mua.g` — ✅ Landed

**Landed** (`f853f74`, `8cddc25`, `95401de`, `b2a72c2`). What shipped, and where it deviated
from the design recorded below:

- The marshaling lives in a **separate** owned popper `lua_pop_object` (arena-backed) plus
  `object_to_lua`, rather than *extending* the borrowing scalar `lua_to_object` — so the tested
  options path stayed byte-for-byte untouched.
- A per-call `Arena` holds the build tree, so a mid-walk rejection at any depth frees with a
  single `arena_finish` before the `lua_error` longjmp — no partial-tree unwinding.
- The copy/free primitives were promoted to shared, **iterative** `api_copy_object` /
  `api_free_object` in [helpers.c](../src/mua/api/private/helpers.c) (explicit stack, no
  recursion — json.h's rule), and options.c was refactored onto them. The planned
  `array_grow`/`dict_grow` proved unnecessary: sizes are known from classification, so backing
  arrays are allocated exactly once.
- Both walks share one `kMarshalDepthCap` (32); on the Lua→Object side it is also the cycle
  guard. Tables classify as Array (keys 1..n), Dict (string keys), or empty→Array.

The original design follows.

- **Goal**: arbitrary-value globals from Lua (`mua.g.x = {...}`, the `vim.g` analog) — and the
  Array/Dict ↔ Lua marshaling every later step needs.
- **Why first**: it is the cross-cutting unblocker (register_tool's schema/args,
  `mua_sess_get_messages`' return, richer hook payloads). `mua.g` is the lowest-risk surface
  to land it behind, mirroring `mua.o` exactly. The options slice deliberately deferred `mua.g`
  rather than ship a scalar-only stub — so doing it right *means* table support, which *means*
  this marshaling.
- **Build**: add `object_to_lua` (the missing counterpart to `lua_to_object`); extend
  `lua_to_object` for `LUA_TTABLE` → Array when keys are a contiguous `1..n` run, else Dict
  (the nvim `nlua_push_Object`/`nlua_pop_Object` heuristic). A new open-ended string→Object
  store `src/mua/variables.c` — the fixed-schema `option_defs[]` in [options.c](../src/mua/options.c)
  won't do for arbitrary keys — documented as mutable singleton #4, with bounded growth and a
  `variables_free` reset hook. `mua_set_var`/`mua_get_var` in [global.c](../src/mua/api/global.c)
  (`FUNC_API_SINCE(2)`). `mua.g` sugar in [runtime/lua/mua/init.lua](../runtime/lua/mua/init.lua),
  the same `setmetatable` forwarding as `mua.o`.
- **Pitfalls**: bounded recursion depth on the table walk (explicit cap, the JSON parse-depth
  limit style); `String` is not NUL-terminated; reuse the longjmp-safe `raise_api_error` free
  pattern (free the C `Error` *before* `lua_error`).
- **Tests**: `mua.g` nested-table round-trip; an over-deep table rejected at the cap;
  `variables_free` in the FFI spec's `before_each` (one busted process shares one copy of the
  store); functional — `init.lua` sets `mua.g`, a later read sees it.

### Step 2 — `mua_register_tool` — ✅ Landed

**Landed** (`bfb7015`, `df16754`, `defcac3`). What shipped, and where it deviated from the design
recorded below:

- **Routed cJSON↔Object↔Lua, not a direct cJSON↔Lua walk.** The json.h boundary rule (cJSON never
  crosses into Lua) won over the "walk against cJSON" sketch below: a new `cjson_to_object` /
  `object_to_cjson` pair in [json.c](../src/mua/json.c) — the one-place converter that comment
  always promised — feeds Step 1's `object_to_lua` / `lua_pop_object`, so the bridge stays
  cJSON-free. Args go cJSON→Object (in tools.c) → Lua; the schema goes Lua→Object (bridge) →
  cJSON (in `mua_register_tool`, the one place); a result goes Lua→Object → string verbatim, or
  Object→cJSON→JSON string for a non-string return. The cJSON↔Object walk shares
  `kMarshalDepthCap` (32), below cJSON's depth-64 limit, so deeper args/schemas are rejected.
- **The callback is a `LuaRef` (a `typedef int` in [defs.h](../src/mua/api/private/defs.h)), a
  dedicated parameter type — not an `Object` variant** (which would couple helpers.c's copy/free
  to Lua). It is held via `luaL_ref`; tools.c stays Lua-agnostic, calling two seams in
  [lua/tool.h](../src/mua/lua/tool.h) (`mua_lua_tool_invoke`/`mua_lua_tool_unref`, the
  `nlua_call_ref` analog) that speak `Object` only.
- **`ToolExecuteFn` gained a threaded `const ToolDef *def`** so one shared `registered_tool_execute`
  serves every dynamic tool, reading its own callback off `def`; the four built-ins ignore it.
- **Result contract** (resolved with the user): a string is content verbatim, any other value is
  JSON-encoded, `nil` → empty, a raising callback → `is_error` (via `lua_pcall`). **Gated by
  default**: `mutating` defaults to `true`. The raw `mua_register_tool` is positional; the kwargs
  `mua.register_tool{...}` is the sugar. `FUNC_API_SINCE(3)`.

The original design follows.

- **Goal**: user-defined tools from Lua (`mua.api.mua_register_tool{name=, description=,
  schema=, callback=}`) — the `nvim_create_user_command` analog, and invariant #4 realized.
- **Build**: promote the registry from the static `tool_defs[]` to static built-ins **plus** a
  dynamic registered list (capped count); `tools_lookup` and `tools_build_openai_array` iterate
  both. A C `ToolExecuteFn` shim marshals the cJSON `args` → Lua, calls the stored callback
  (held via `luaL_ref`), marshals the returned Lua value → `ToolResult{content, is_error}`, and
  fires `done` **inline** (Lua is synchronous → return `NULL`, the sync half of the contract).
  Store a registered tool's schema as a cJSON tree on the dynamic entry (built-ins keep their
  static `params_schema` string); `tools_build_openai_array` branches on which it holds.
- **Pitfalls**: this is the cJSON↔Lua axis, distinct from Step 1's Object↔Lua — reuse the
  depth-capped walk but against cJSON. A callback that errors must become
  `ToolResult{is_error=true}` (wrap the call in `lua_pcall`), never a `lua_error` thrown across
  the agent loop. The callback runs on the event-loop thread — fine for sync, but a slow Lua
  tool blocks the loop; document it.
- **Tests**: functional — `init.lua` registers a tool, the SSE fixture emits a `tool_call` for
  it, assert the callback ran, its result reached the next request, and the tool appears in the
  request `tools` array; a raising callback → `is_error` result, turn continues.

*(Loosely coupled with Step 3 and could swap with it. It comes first because hooks are most
useful once user tools exist, and because it forces the cJSON↔Lua args marshaling that Step 3's
`ToolPre`/`ToolPost` payloads reuse.)*

### Step 3 — Autocmd event set — ✅ Landed

**Landed** (`b76a18f`, `b8138eb`, `70c00af`). What shipped, and where it deviated from the design
recorded below:

- **`ToolPre` fires for *every* tool, not only mutating ones.** Resolved with the user: instead of
  wrapping the mutating-only gate, the gate is now consulted for every tool (the `start_tool` guard
  relaxed to `if (turn->cb.gate != NULL)`) and the mutating-only human y/N moved *into* the policies
  (`agent_gate_auto_refuse`/`agent_gate_interactive` approve non-mutating tools up front).
  Behavior-preserving — the existing gate tests pin it — and now `ToolPre` observes/vetoes reads too.
- **All five events dispatch from main.c**, not agent.c — the settled agent loop gains no
  Lua/autocmd knowledge. `ToolPre` rides a composing gate (`gate_with_autocmds`) wrapping the chosen
  policy (`TurnCtx.base_gate`); `StreamDelta`←`on_text`, `ToolPost`←`on_tool_result`,
  `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`←`run_agent`. cJSON stays out of the bridge: main.c marshals the
  `ToolPre` args cJSON→Object, the seam takes Object→Lua.
- **Store is core** ([autocmd.c](../src/mua/autocmd.c), singleton #5, `{id, event, LuaRef}`); the
  four dispatch seams live in the bridge (reuse the static `object_to_lua`). `mua_lua_tool_unref`
  generalized to a shared `mua_lua_unref` ([lua/ref.h](../src/mua/lua/ref.h)). **Veto/approve/rewrite
  convention**: a `ToolPre` hook returns `false` (generic) or a string reason to veto, `true` to
  approve the call outright (the base gate is skipped, so no y/N prompt), or a table to rewrite the
  tool's arguments to that table; a throw is caught (nonfatal), none of the three.
- The callback receives one table `{ event, ... }`; raw `mua_create_autocmd(event, callback)` is 1:1
  with C, and `mua.create_autocmd(event, {callback=})` is the nvim-shaped sugar.
- **`ToolPre` argument rewrite** (follow-on): a table return rewrites the args, extending the gate.
  `AgentGateFn` gained a `cJSON **rewrite_out`; `mua_lua_autocmd_tool_pre` returns the rewritten args
  as a heap `Object` (the bridge stays cJSON-free), `gate_with_autocmds` converts it `object_to_cjson`
  and validates it is an object, and `start_tool` swaps `args` before execute. Hooks chain (each sees
  the prior rewrite via the shared payload `args`); a veto still wins. Approval is orthogonal — the
  rewritten args flow into the base gate, so a mutating tool still hits the y/N (now showing the
  rewrite). The grep→rg-hook use case, expressed in user `init.lua`.
- **`ToolPre` approve outcome** (follow-on): a hook returning boolean `true` approves the call
  outright. `mua_lua_autocmd_tool_pre` gained a `bool *approve_out` (a later veto still wins over an
  approve); `gate_with_autocmds` returns `kGateApprove` before consulting `ctx->base_gate`, so the
  call runs with no prompt regardless of the base policy (interactive / `-p`). Composes with rewrite
  (approved + rewritten args run silently). The programmatic-allowlist seam — an opencode-style
  permission policy in user `init.lua` returns `true` to allow, a string to deny, and `nil` to defer
  to the normal gate.

The original design follows (note: `ToolPre` ended up at the composing gate for *all* tools, not the
mutating-only chokepoint, and `on_tool_start` was not used).

- **Goal**: `mua.api.mua_create_autocmd("ToolPre", {callback = ...})` over the fixed event set
  `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`/`ToolPre`/`ToolPost`/`StreamDelta` — invariant #5 realized.
- **Build**: an event enum and a bounded registration store (event → list of callback refs);
  `mua_create_autocmd`/`mua_clear_autocmds`. Dispatch at the C callback seams that **already
  exist** — this is wiring, not new control flow:
  - `StreamDelta` ← `provider_on_text` ([agent.c](../src/mua/agent.c)). Hot path: keep the
    no-handler case a single nil-check.
  - `ToolPre` ← the `AgentGateFn` chokepoint (`turn->cb.gate(...)` in
    [agent.c](../src/mua/agent.c)). The **only** veto-capable event: a hook returning false maps
    to `kGateRefuse` and a synthetic result. The `on_tool_start` callback is its notify side.
  - `ToolPost` ← the `on_tool_result` call ([agent.c](../src/mua/agent.c)).
  - `SessionStart` ← after `setup_session`; `SessionEnd` ← before `session_free`
    (both in [main.c](../src/mua/main.c)).
- **Pitfalls**: record how `ToolPre` composes with the built-in interactive gate — recommended:
  Lua hooks run first, and a refusal short-circuits the y/N prompt. A throwing hook must be
  nonfatal (pcall, log, continue). `ToolPre`/`ToolPost` payloads carry the tool name and an args
  Dict → need Steps 1–2 marshaling.
- **Tests**: functional — a `ToolPost` hook fires once per tool; a `ToolPre` returning false
  refuses the tool (synthetic error, no execute); `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd` fire once each; a
  throwing hook is nonfatal.

### Step 4 — Session scope `mua_sess_*` — ✅ Landed

**Landed** (`4379ab8`, `8e85598`). What shipped, and where it deviated from the design below:

- **A current-session registry, not yet a handle table.** The design called for a
  handle→`SessionState *` table; with one implicit session, it shipped as a borrowed current-session
  pointer + resolver (`session_set_current`/`session_resolve` in
  [session.c](../src/mua/session.c), mutable singleton #6). main.c registers the run's session
  before `SessionStart` and clears it (NULL) after `SessionEnd`, before `session_free`, so a stale
  handle resolves to a clean error rather than freed memory. `0` resolves to it; every nonzero handle
  is an unknown-handle Validation error today. `session_resolve` is the single seam a real
  multi-session table later slots into without touching the API.
- **The first integer-handle scope.** `mua_sess_get_messages(Session, Error *)` returns the
  conversation as an owned `Array` of message Dicts; `mua_sess_get_id` the id `String`; `0` = current
  (the `nvim_buf_*` analog), `FUNC_API_SINCE(4)`. New [api/session.c](../src/mua/api/session.c) — the
  one-file-per-scope layout. Read-only: no append-from-Lua.
- **Marshaling at the one boundary place.** `get_messages` converts `session_messages` cJSON→Object
  via `cjson_to_object` inside the API layer (json.h's sanctioned spot) and returns an `Array`; the
  bridge wraps it `ARRAY_OBJ`→`object_to_lua` and stays cJSON-free. The Array is a fresh copy, so it
  outlives any later append — the borrow-lifetime pitfall below is dissolved by the copy; on the Lua
  side only the integer handle is visible, so caching it is safe.
- The bridge exposes `l_mua_sess_get_messages`/`l_mua_sess_get_id` (handle defaults to 0, like
  `nvim_buf_*` accept 0); `mua.sess.get_messages`/`get_id` is the sugar.

The original design follows.

- **Goal**: a session-scoped read API — `mua_sess_get_messages(Session, Error *)`,
  `mua_sess_get_id(Session, Error *)` — with the `Session` handle and `0` = current, the
  `nvim_buf_*` analog. (The session module's vocabulary already presages this.)
- **Build**: a handle→`SessionState *` table; today there is one implicit session, so introduce
  the indirection where `0` resolves to the current run's session. `mua_sess_get_messages`
  returns the conversation as an Array, reusing Step 1's marshaling over `session_messages`
  ([session.c](../src/mua/session.c)). New file `src/mua/api/session.c` — the contract's
  one-file-per-scope layout (`global.c`/`session.c`/`tools.c`). Read-only this slice: no
  append-from-Lua, which would risk the borrow-lifetime invariant.
- **Pitfalls**: borrow lifetime — `session_messages` is valid only until the next append;
  marshaling to a fresh Lua table copies, so the returned value is safe, but document that a
  caller must not cache a session pointer/handle across turns. `0` = current must raise a clean
  Validation error when there is no current session.
- **Tests**: unit — handle `0` resolves, a bad handle → Validation error; functional — a
  tool or hook calls `mua_sess_get_messages(0)` and sees the conversation so far.

### Step 5 — `--embed` msgpack-RPC server — ✅ Landed

**Landed** (`87536f0`, `d5e5e9d`, `4296382`). What shipped, and where it deviated from the design
below:

- **Shared dispatch table, hand-written (not a code generator).** A single `ApiFnMeta[]`
  (`{name, dispatch-fn, since}`) in [api/dispatch.c](../src/mua/api/dispatch.c) holds the **6**
  marshalable functions (`set/get_option`, `set/get_var`, `sess_get_messages/get_id`); each wrapper
  adapts the real API fn to a uniform `Object (Array args, Error *)` shape. It drives **both** the
  Lua bridge — the six bespoke `l_mua_*` getters/setters collapsed into one `l_api_dispatch` closure
  (−105 lines in bridge.c) — and the RPC server. `register_tool`/`create_autocmd` take a `LuaRef`
  (a callback can't cross RPC) and `clear_autocmds` has no `Error`/since, so all three stay bespoke
  Lua wrappers, excluded from the table.
- **Object↔msgpack is a hand-written codec** ([msgpack.c](../src/mua/msgpack.c), the third
  marshaling axis), not a vendored library — matching mua's "few dependencies" stance. Iterative,
  depth-capped walks mirroring json.c; the decoder is partial-input-aware (`kMsgpackIncomplete`) and
  bounds container sizes against the remaining bytes so a lying huge count never allocates.
- **Transport is `uv_pipe` on fd 0/1** ([rpc.c](../src/mua/rpc.c), Lua-free), dispatch synchronous
  (no model calls in this mode), so a SIGINT handled by the loop stops it cleanly. The buffer is
  capped (16 MiB); a malformed/oversized stream closes the channel; an unknown method or bad params
  is an error response, never a crash. Stack-allocated handles are closed and drained before
  `rpc_serve` returns on every path, so `loop_close` never touches freed memory.
- **A read/write API server this slice**: `mua --embed` serves the 6 functions against the config
  `init.lua` set up; it runs **no** agent turns and opens **no** session (so `mua_sess_*` cleanly
  errors), and since no turn runs, no autocmd events fire — outbound RPC notifications are moot and
  deferred. Driving a turn over RPC is future work.

The original design follows.

- **Goal**: drive mua from an external process over msgpack-RPC on stdio — the nvim `--embed`
  analog; the capstone that proves `mua.api` is a real surface, not just Lua glue.
- **Build**: first the prerequisite — today's `api_functions[]` table is `lua_CFunction`-specific
  and not reusable by RPC. Introduce a shared API-metadata table (`{name, fn-ptr, arg/return
  Object signature}`) that **both** the Lua bridge and the RPC dispatcher consume — what
  `FUNC_API_SINCE` was always feeding. Then msgpack encode/decode (Object↔msgpack — mechanical
  and total, since `Object` already has Array/Dict), a stdio channel with
  request/response/notification framing, and the `--embed` CLI flag.
- **Pitfalls**: the largest, greenfield step. Do the shared-metadata refactor *first* so it
  retro-simplifies the Lua bridge (the per-function `l_mua_*` wrappers collapse into one
  table-driven dispatch). Bound message size and decode depth on the RPC read loop — it is
  untrusted, unbounded input.
- **Tests**: functional — spawn `mua --embed`, send a msgpack `mua_set_option`/`mua_get_option`
  request, assert the response; confirm the one metadata table drives both Lua and RPC.

## Out of scope (deferred past this milestone)

Append-from-Lua to a session (`mua_sess_append`) and tool *cancellation* from Lua both touch
the borrow/lifetime invariants and wait until the read-only surface above is settled. The async
half of the tool contract is unused by Lua tools (they are synchronous); a future Lua tool that
needs to await I/O would model it on the libuv handle pattern the `bash` tool already uses.
